    {
        'Main question': 'What is a sorting algorithm in the context of algorithm basics?',
        'Explanation': 'The respondent should define sorting algorithms as methods or routines used to arrange elements in a specific order, often in ascending or descending sequences. Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in organizing data efficiently for various applications and are fundamental to computer science and programming.',
