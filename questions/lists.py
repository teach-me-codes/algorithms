        'Main question': 'What is a List in the context of basic data structures?',
        'Explanation': 'A List in basic data structures refers to a dynamic array in Python that can store elements of different types and supports operations like indexing, slicing, and appending for efficient data manipulation.',

    {
        'Main question': 'How can nested Lists be used for complex data structures in Python?',
        'Explanation': 'Nested Lists in Python allow for the creation of multidimensional data structures, where individual elements can be Lists themselves, enabling the representation of complex relationships and hierarchical data in a structured format.',

    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy operations in relation to Lists?',
        'Explanation': 'Shallow copy refers to creating a new List object that references the original List\'s elements, while deep copy involves creating a separate copy with new references to all nested elements, ensuring that changes in one List do not affect the other.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does the copy() method in Python differentiate between shallow and deep copying operations?', 'Can you discuss scenarios where shallow copy might be preferred over deep copy or vice versa when working with Lists?', 'What impact does mutable versus immutable data types have on shallow and deep copying behaviors in Python Lists?']
