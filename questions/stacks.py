        'Main question': 'What is a stack in the context of advanced data structures?',
        'Explanation': 'A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure that allows adding and removing elements from the top. Stacks are commonly used in function call management and expression evaluation in computer science.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle differentiate stacks from other data structures?', 'What are the primary operations that can be performed on a stack?', 'Can you provide examples of real-world applications where stacks are utilized?']

        'Main question': 'How is a stack implemented in programming languages?',
        'Explanation': 'Explain the various ways stacks can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or dynamic arrays in programming languages. Each implementation has unique advantages and limitations in terms of efficiency and memory usage.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What factors should be considered when choosing a specific implementation of a stack?', 'How does the choice of implementation impact the performance of stack operations like push and pop?', 'Compare the trade-offs between array-based and linked list-based stack implementations.']

        'Main question': 'What are the fundamental operations that can be performed on a stack?',
        'Explanation': 'Outline key stack operations like push (adding an element to the top), pop (removing the top element), peek (viewing the top element without removal), and isEmpty (checking if the stack is empty).
