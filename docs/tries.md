- **Deletion**: Requires marking the last character as a leaf node or removing nodes.
- **Lookup**: Efficiently checks word or prefix existence in the Trie.

Tries provide an efficient solution for string operations, enhancing systems requiring quick and accurate textual suggestions. The organized structure of Tries enables effective prefix-based searches, improving performance in text handling applications that demand swift and precise suggestions and validations.
# Tries: Efficient Prefix-Based Search Data Structures

## 1. Types of Tries

### 1.1 Standard Trie
- **Explanation of Standard Trie Structure:**
  - A standard trie, also known as a digital tree or prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings. Each node of the trie represents a single character, and paths from the root to a node form the string associated with that node.
  
- **Implementation Details of Standard Trie:**
  ```python
  class TrieNode:
      def __init__(self):
          self.children = [None] * 26  # Assuming only lowercase alphabets
          self.is_end_of_word = False
  
  class Trie:
      def __init__(self):
          self.root = TrieNode()
  
      def insert(self, word):
          node = self.root
          for char in word:
              index = ord(char) - ord('a')
              if not node.children[index]:
                  node.children[index] = TrieNode()
              node = node.children[index]
          node.is_end_of_word = True
  ```

### 1.2 Compressed Trie
- **Introduction to Compressed Trie:**
  - Compressed tries, such as compressed suffix tries or compact prefix trees, reduce space complexity by compressing chains of nodes with only one child into a single node. This optimization minimizes storage requirements and enhances search efficiency.

- **Advantages of Compressed Trie over Standard Trie:**
  - *Improved Space Efficiency*: Compressed tries reduce memory consumption by consolidating redundant nodes, especially in scenarios where a chain of nodes only has a single child.
  - *Enhanced Search Performance*: The compression of nodes reduces traversal steps, leading to faster search operations compared to standard tries.

### 1.3 Ternary Search Trie
- **Definition and Purpose of Ternary Search Tries:**
  - Ternary search tries are a variation of tries where each node has three child pointers instead of the standard two. This structure efficiently supports operations like autocomplete, spell-checking, and dictionary-based search applications.
  
- **How Ternary Search Tries Optimize Memory Usage:**
  - Ternary search tries optimize memory by maintaining a compact structure while allowing flexible search capabilities. The middle child pointer in each node divides the alphabet range, leading to a more balanced tree structure and reduced memory overhead.

By understanding the nuances of different types of tries, developers can leverage these efficient data structures for a wide range of applications requiring prefix-based search functionalities.

            self.root = TrieNode()
    
        def insert(self, word):
            current = self.root
            for char in word:
                if char not in current.children:
                    current.children[char] = TrieNode()
                current = current.children[char]
            current.is_end_of_word = True
    
    # Insert "bar" into the Trie
    trie = Trie()
    trie.insert("bar")
    ```
