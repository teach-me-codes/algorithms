#### Collision Resolution Techniques

1. **Chaining:**
    - In chaining, each bucket in the table contains a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
    - When a collision happens, the new key-value pair is appended to the linked list at that index.
    - **Mathematical Representation:**
        - Let $n$ be the number of slots in the table.
        - The probability of two keys hashing to the same slot is given by the load factor $\alpha = \x0crac{m}{n}$, where $m$ is the number of keys hashed to the table.

    ```python
    # Example of Chaining in Python
    class HashTable:
        def __init__(self):
            self.table = [[] for _ in range(10)]
    ```

2. **Open Addressing:**
    - Open addressing is a technique where all key-value pairs are stored directly within the Hash Table without utilizing additional data structures like linked lists.
    - When a collision occurs, the algorithm probes sequentially through the table to find the next available empty slot.
    - **Linear Probing:** 
        - In linear probing, the algorithm linearly searches for the next free slot following a collision.
        - It can lead to clustering issues where consecutive slots are filled, potentially slowing down retrieval.

    ```python
    # Example of Linear Probing in Python
    class HashTable:
        def __init__(self):
            self.table = [None] * 10
        
        def linear_probe(self, key):
            index = self.hash_function(key)
            while self.table[index] is not None:
                index = (index + 1) % 10
    ```

## Answer

### How Hash Tables Handle Deletion of Elements

Hash Tables are efficient data structures that utilize a hash function to map keys to values. Deletion of elements in a Hash Table involves several key steps to maintain data integrity and performance:

1. **Process of Deleting Elements**:
   - To delete an element from a Hash Table, the key of the element is used to locate the corresponding bucket.
   - Subsequently, the element can be marked as deleted, or the bucket can be removed entirely if the element is the sole entry in the bucket.
   - Dealing with collisions is crucial during the deletion process. If multiple elements hash to the same bucket (collision), methodologies like chaining or open addressing are utilized to identify and remove the correct element.

2. **Updating Table Structure**:
   - Post-deletion, adjustments to the Hash Table structure might be necessary to prevent clustering or diminished performance.
   - Rehashing could be essential to redistribute elements evenly and maintain a balanced load factor, ensuring effective data retrieval and storage.
