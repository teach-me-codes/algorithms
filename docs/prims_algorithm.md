### Prim's Algorithm: Selecting the Next Vertex for Minimum Spanning Tree

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The algorithm grows the minimum spanning tree step by step, selecting the vertex with the minimum edge weight to add to the tree at each iteration. 

#### How does Prim's Algorithm select the next vertex to add to the minimum spanning tree?

- At the beginning, a vertex is chosen arbitrarily as the starting point.
- The algorithm maintains two sets of vertices:
    - **MST_Set**: Vertices already included in the minimum spanning tree.
    - **Non_MST_Set**: Vertices not yet included in the minimum spanning tree.
- The process iterates until all vertices are included in the minimum spanning tree:
    1. Start with the initial vertex.
    2. Find the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex from **MST_Set** to a vertex in **Non_MST_Set**.
    3. Select the vertex with the minimum weight edge and move it to **MST_Set**.
    4. Update the **Non_MST_Set** by adding the newly included vertex and removing it from the original set.

This selection process ensures that the tree grows by including vertices with the smallest connected edge weights, forming the minimum spanning tree.

Fibonacci Heaps provide faster amortized time complexity for operations like insertion and extraction of the minimum key, which can speed up the selection process.

#### How does the choice of starting vertex impact the final minimum spanning tree obtained using Prim's Algorithm?

- The choice of the starting vertex affects the resulting minimum spanning tree obtained with Prim's Algorithm.
- While the overall structure of the minimum spanning tree remains the same irrespective of the starting vertex, the edge weights and specific paths may vary.
- In some cases, selecting a different starting vertex may lead to different edge choices, especially when there are multiple edges with the same weight. This variation can influence the order in which vertices are added to the tree, affecting the final arrangement.
- However, the final minimum spanning tree preserves the property of being a tree that spans all vertices with the minimum total weight.

### Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees

Prim's Algorithm is a popular method used to find the minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph. By taking a greedy approach, it selects edges that form the minimum spanning tree while ensuring connectivity and minimizing total edge weights.

#### How does Prim's Algorithm ensure the connectivity and minimality of the spanning tree it constructs?

1. **Initialization**:
