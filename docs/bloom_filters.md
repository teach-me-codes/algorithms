A **Bloom Filter** is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It consists of a bit array of $$ m $$ bits, initially all set to 0, and a set of $$ k $$ independent hash functions. When an element is inserted into the Bloom Filter, it is hashed by each hash function to multiple positions in the array, and the corresponding bits are set to 1. To check for membership, the same hash functions are applied to the element, and if all corresponding bits are set to 1, the element is probably in the set; if any bit is 0, the element is definitely not in the set. However, it may produce false positives but never false negatives.
